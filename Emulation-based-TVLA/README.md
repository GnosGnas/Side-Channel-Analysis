# Emulation Based *Test Vector Leakage Assessment*
For emulation based TVLA, we have to emulate the targetted hardware on an FPGA and collect the power traces corresponding to each cipher process. We then compute the TVLA score with the traces.

## Introduction
Advanced Encryption Standard, or AES, is a popular symmetric algorithm for encryption. It has been a replacement for DES algorithm which failed to protect data due to its small key. The features of AES are as follows:
- Symmetric key symmetric block cipher
- 128-bit data, 128/192/256-bit keys
- Stronger and faster than Triple-DES
AES is an iterative algorithm and number of rounds of a process is determined by the length of the Key.

Side-channel attacks started becoming more viable as compared to exhaustive search and one of the attacks proven to be fatal are power analysis attacks. Non-invasive attacks like SPA and DPA are particularly dangerous as they can be easily reproduced and scaled. So, enter Test Vector Leakage Assessment Methodology (TVLA), a popular side-channel testing methodology recommended by NIST as it can detect power leakages at any time of the operation irrespective of whether an attack can be successfully performed or not with that leakage. 

TVLA aims to provide detection of information leakage using statistical analysis. The aim of this project is to evaluate the vulnerability of Shakti's AES accelerators which can be integrated with the Shakti C-Class processor.

## Side-channel evaluation methodology
The procedure followed here is for non-specific TVLA test on an FPGA.
1. **Make a wrapper module for the accelerators to feed the inputs**:  
	If the target hardware is a processor, then no such wrapper module is required and an appropriate C-code can be used to feed the inputs. In the wrapper module, inputs for processing are given along with the trigger. Ideally, there should not be any other process during the targetted process so that the TVLA test gives more accurate conclusion. Example of such a process would be storing of the output into registers which should be done outside the trigger.
2. **Configuring the module for the FPGA**:  
	This is very important as for side-channel evaluation custom FPGA boards are used. A Top module above the wrapper module was required in our setup to map the appropriate ports to the pins and to convert the different clock to single-ended clock.
3. **Configuring the oscilloscope**:  
	The oscilloscope needs to be configured for collecting trigger and power consumption values. We also have to configure the resolution and sampling rate per trigger. Remote setup would be beneficial.
4. **Program the FPGA**:  
	For programming, we used Xilinx Vivado 2020.1. Use a tool which has the given FPGA's configuration files and required features. It is suggested to add probes so that the user can keep track by remotely monitoring the computer.
5. **Collect the traces and evaluate the TVLA score**:  
	While moving files from one device to another, zip the files to prevent any data loss. Reduction parallelism can be used to speed up the computation of TVLA score (maximum t-value). It is also suggested to collect traces couple of times due to physical randomness and possibility of false or missing triggers.

## More about TVLA:
The reasons for its popularity are as follows:  
1. Reproducible results and reasonable conditions of testing
2. User controlled test vector suite with updates
3. Ease of testing and low cost in terms of time and resources
4. No need for exceptional operator skills or specialised hardware.

TVLA uses Welch's t-test, a PASS/FAIL test that checks if t-value crosses a predefined threshold (proposed as Â±4.5).It is to be noted that this is not sufficient to objectively tell that the device leaks data, which can
be confirmed only by performing side-channel attacks. More details can be found in the report.  
T-value is given by, $t=\frac{\mu_A - \mu_B}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_A^{2}}{n_A}+\frac{\sigma_B^{2}}{n_B}}}.$  
where A and B correspond to the fixed and random dataset.

## AES-with-wrapper
For feeding the inputs to the accelerator, Wrapper modules were made in Bluespec SystemVerilog. The methodology followed for feeding the inputs is as described by NIST standards. Advantages of this configuration are as follows:
1. Very less resources are consumed. Hence synthesis and implementation of the design is very fast. 
2. For TVLA, we need the power consumed to be purely that of the cipher process so in this approach we have better control over the overhead power consumed.
3. No extensive knowledge is required in replicating this for other cipher modules

## Shakti C-Class
**NOTE**: The C-Class used here is an older version and newer versions can be found in Shakti repository. Currently, the files need to be debugged as there were some rule conflicts and it was found to not work on the FPGA even though it compiled and synthesized. 

This is the most practical way of testing as it involves a processor too. C code can be used to write how the inputs are to be fed and no knowledge of the architecture is required if the setup has already been given. Advantages are as follows:
1. Evaluation of an accelerator in a practical scenario
2. If a user wants to simply test if the results are as expected, only a C code needs to be written for all the cipher processes.
3. If the FPGA is configured once then only the hex file of the C code needs to be loaded for each test which happens very quickly

## TVLA scripts
Two python codes are present in this subdirectory:
- TVLA_basic.py
- TVLA_threaded.py

TVLA_threaded.py uses multithreading and reduction parallelism to speedup the computation. More details can be found in the report.

TVLA results are available in the subdirectory Report.
