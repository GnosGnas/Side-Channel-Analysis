# things to do
# create folder for each benchmark circuit let it be ckt1
# inside ckt1 create folder called reports
# copy these three files .synopsys_dc_130.setup, synth.tcl & block.sdc * Note: verilog file also should be inside ckt1
# rename aes_128 to the name of the random verilog file that is created
# synthesize once with clock at 0 in block.sdc & max_delay 0.0 note the delay value in modulename_timing.txt
# replace clock with magnitude value and set period accordingly and max_delay to the same value and resynthesize
# run using the following command  1. source /tools/setup.sh 2. dc_shell -f synth.tcl
