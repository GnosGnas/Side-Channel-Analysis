JC2_VER is a bi-directional 4-bit Johnson counter with stop control.

DESIGN FLOW: Stand-alone Verilog design (JC2_TOP.V)

TARGET DEVICE: XC9572XL-CS48 (any speed)

I/O PINS:
	CLK       : input free-running clock 
	LEFT      : input signal to shift left (active-low switch)
	RIGHT     : input signal to shift right (active-low switch)
	STOP      : input signal to stop counting (active-low switch)
	Q<3>-Q<0> : counter outputs (active-low LEDs; Q0 is right-most)

OPERATION:
	The counter is triggered on the rising edge of the clock (CLK). 
	A low pulse on the LEFT input will cause the counter to start 
	shifting left from its current state. A low pulse on the RIGHT
	input will cause the counter to start shifting right from its 
	current state. A low pulse on the STOP input will cause the 
	counter to hold its current state until LEFT or RIGHT is pulsed.

        The following sequence appears on outputs Q<3>-Q<0> when shifting left:
		0000
		0001
		0011
		0111
		1111
		1110
		1100
		1000
		0000 (repeats)

        The following sequence appears on outputs Q<3>-Q<0> when shifting right:
		0000
		1000
		1100
		1110
		1111
		0111
		0011
		0001
		0000 (repeats)

	After power-up, the counter is stopped with all outputs low (LEDs lit).
 
SIMULATION:
	Verilog functional simulation test fixture is provided in JC2_FUNC.TF.
	Verilog timing simulation test fixture is provided in JC2_TIM.TF.

Using the jc2_top.ucf file, the Johnson Counter design used in this 
example can be downloaded to the xc9572-cs48 FAE Demo board.  
(note: If using Synplify, Synplify Pro, or LeonardoSpectrum for synthesis
the jc.ucf file will need to be edited as indicated in the file.)
